# Personal-Website
The original incarnation of my personal website. It was basically just slapped together to give me some sort of online professional presence outside of linkedin, and to prove that I could indeed write and host a website. It wasn't a very good one. It looked okay on desktop, but wasn't responsive at all to different screen sizes.
